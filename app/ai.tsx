Current conditions:
- Location: ${location.city}, ${location.region}
- Cloud type: ${cloudInfo.scientificName} (${cloudInfo.kidFriendlyName})
- Altitude: ${cloudInfo.altitude}
- Temperature: ${temp}Â°F
- Wind speed: ${windSpeed} mph
- Humidity: ${humidity}%

Information to include:
1. Greet the listener and tell them what clouds are overhead right now
2. Describe what the clouds look like: "${cloudInfo.description}"
3. Share the fun fact: "${cloudInfo.funFact}"
4. Explain what weather patterns created these clouds (considering temp, humidity, wind)
5. Predict where these clouds might go or what weather might come next

Tone: Warm, enthusiastic, educational but playful. Use simple words and vivid imagery. Make it feel magical and exciting!

Format: Write ONLY the spoken script, no stage directions or labels. Make it conversational and fun, like you're talking to a curious kid looking up at the sky.`;
